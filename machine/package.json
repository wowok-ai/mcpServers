  "description": "Operations to create or modify an on-chain Machine object, where the 'account' field is used to sign transactions and the 'data' field defines object details. \nThe Machine object enables its manager to orchestrate collaborative workflows, manage permissions, and validate deliverables on-chain. It achieves reusable workflow execution through the generation of distinct instances (Progress objects), such as service processes for e-commerce orders. Core functionalities include:\n- Workflow Orchestration : Defines multi-stage collaborative workflows (e.g., Requirement Confirmation → Development → Testing → Acceptance) with parallel or sequential execution, specifying step order and trigger conditions to support complex collaboration scenarios.\n- Permission Management : Assigns granular operational permissions to collaborators (e.g., only service providers can execute development steps; only purchasers can approve acceptance steps), and sets namespace-specific permissions for different workflow instances (Progress objects) (e.g., distinct delivery personnel for different Progress objects).\n- Delivery Validation : Implements automatic validation rules via Guard objects (e.g., verifying updates to the latest data in a named Repository or confirming purchase order fulfillment as committed).\nMachine administrators control permissions for different operations through a Permission object and can configure namespaces to provide unified permission operation spaces for different instances (Progress objects). Once published, the workflow orchestration and delivery validation rules of a Machine object become immutable. To enhance a Machine, a new Machine object can be generated and modified via the Clone method.",
