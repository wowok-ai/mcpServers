  "description": "Operations to create or modify an on-chain Arbitration object, where the 'account' field is used to sign transactions and the 'data' field defines object details. Guard object is immutable once created. A Guard object is designed to define a set of verification conditions that yield a final boolean result (True or False). These conditions include querying on-chain object data (e.g., verifying if an order owner is 0x1234, or if 100 SUI tokens were paid from a specific Treasury object to 0x1234 and an order(owned by 0x1234) of a Service object  has reached the 'express loss verification' process node), validating Witness data provided by the signer (e.g., the provided order address must belong to a certain Service object, and the order owner must be the actual transaction signer), and performing mathematical/logical operations on numerical values. Due to its immutability, the Guard object is widely used as a pre-validation requirement for critical operations (e.g., placing an order for a Service object or withdrawing funds from a Treasury object). Additionally, Guard objects can be integrated with Permission object's operation validation: an operation is only executed if both the permission requirements and the Guard verification are satisfied.",
